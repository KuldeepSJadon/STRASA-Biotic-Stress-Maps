# STRASA
This repository hosts R scripts for generating maps of biotic stresses for the Stress-Tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA) project. These files are generated from outputs of the EPIRICE model (Savary et al. 2012) in conjunction with the FAO's Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL; 2015-2014) data set.

To use these data, you will need to download the GAUL dataset, GAUL - Second level - Reference year 2014, from FAO's website: http://data.fao.org/map?entryId=f7e7adb0-88fd-11da-a88f-000d939bc5d8&tab=metadata.

The "Data" folder contains .csv files with unmodified values that can be used with a GIS program such as ArcGIS or QGIS to link the data in the .csv file with the GAUL data set.
